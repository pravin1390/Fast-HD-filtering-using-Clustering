IMPORTANT POINTS

Main files in the code:
1) bilateral_approx.m - For bilateral filtering of high-dimensional images.
2) nlm_approx.m - For non-local means filtering of high-dimensional images. 

If you need to use O(1) Gaussian filtering, you have to create mex file for young.cpp using the command
mex young.cpp
